This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## IB Fresh Fish tools — layout

This project now includes a base layout and placeholder tools to build on for the IB Fresh Fish platform. Files of interest:

- `components/Topbar.tsx` — top navigation and company brand
- `components/Sidebar.tsx` — left navigation for sections and tools
- `components/Footer.tsx` — footer with company copyright
- `app/layout.tsx` — root layout wiring the components into the app
- `app/tools/*` — placeholder tool views (Price Manager, Route Planner, Inventory)

To run the app locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

I'll add more views and tool logic as you instruct — tell me which tool you'd like to implement next.
